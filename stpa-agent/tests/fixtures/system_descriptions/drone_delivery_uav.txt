System description: A delivery UAV transports small packages between local hubs.
Controller: onboard autopilot plans routes while a remote operator can override.
Sensors include GPS, barometer, obstacle detection cameras, and IMU telemetry.
Actuators are the rotors and control surfaces that adjust thrust and attitude.
Feedback comes from telemetry links and onboard status indicators.
Safety context: avoid collisions, maintain altitude limits, and protect people below.
Assumptions: GPS is available and delivery zones are pre-approved.
