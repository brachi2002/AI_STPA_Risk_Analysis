System description: An automotive emergency braking system assists drivers in urban traffic.
Controller: vehicle ECU evaluates sensor inputs and decides when to apply braking.
Sensors include radar, camera, and wheel speed sensors monitoring obstacles and speed.
Actuators are the brake hydraulics and throttle cut that reduce vehicle speed.
Feedback is provided via dashboard warnings and brake pressure status.
Safety context: prevent rear-end collisions and reduce impact severity.
Assumptions: sensors are calibrated and road friction is within normal ranges.
